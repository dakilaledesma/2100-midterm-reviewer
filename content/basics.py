        Variables are used to store data. They are used to make code more readable and easier to understand. 
        Variables are declared by assigning a value to a name. For example:
        ```python
        x = 5
        ```
        In the above example, `x` is the variable name and `5` is the value. Variables can be assigned to any data 
        type. For example:
        ```python
        y = "hello world"
        z = [1, 2, 3]
        ```
        In the above example, `y` is a string and `z` is a list. Variables can also be reassigned to a different value.
        For example:
        ```python
        x = 5
        x = 10
        ```
        In the above example, `x` is reassigned to `10`. Variables can also be used in expressions. For example:
        ```python
        x = 5
        y = 10
        z = x + y
        ```
        In the above example, `z` is assigned to the value of `x + y`, which is `15`.
